  	<h4>Here at <div class="logo"> G V D</div>, we uderstand that each and every website is unique. Unlike our competitors, we truly take into account the fact that no website requires the same amount of time and effort to build. Therefore, no website should cost the client the same amount of money based on some rediculous minimum cost!</h4>
  	<h4>Instead, we offer a dynamic and flexible pricing model that truly reflects each projects true cost to build. Our pricing model is as follows:</h4>
  	<h4>Onset of production: <div class="price">$200.00</div><br>Production cost: <div class="price">$????.00</div><br>Project completion: <div class="price">$200.00</div></h4>
  	<h4>As you can see from our pricing model above, there is no set minimum price for any single project's production cost. The only fixed costs are two installments of $200.00, one at the onset of production, and the other at the time when the project is completed. You WILL NOT find more competitive prices anywhere else, GUARENTEED.</h4>
